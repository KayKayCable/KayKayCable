# KeywordSearch

KeywordSearch was a school project that set out to read text from text files and compile a list of all instances of a keyword match. I tried to enhance the search distance further 
by using ideas from spellcheckers and the damerau-levenshtein formula to create a list of possible misspellings. However I ran into some efficiency issues and the program 
currently only works with an exact match search that ignores the enhancements.
